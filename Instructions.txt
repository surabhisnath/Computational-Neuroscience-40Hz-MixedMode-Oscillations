Download the entire folder ICN_Assignment3 and retain the same directory structure.

To run the code, open code/Ionic basis for intrinsic 40Hz neuronal oscillations.ipynb and run all cells in order. 

The plots take long to simulate, hence pickle files are provided to directly load arrays from them (Plots_Fig2.ipynb, Plots_Fig3ab.ipynb and Plots_Fig3c.ipynb are used to generate those pickle files). 

The answers to all theory questions can be found in Questions.pdf

The last theory question has been answered in Questions.pdf and simulated in Ionic basis for intrinsic 40Hz neuronal oscillations.ipynb in the last few cells.
